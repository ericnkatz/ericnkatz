### ðŸ‘‹. Hello there! 

I love technolgy, UX/UI and Front End Engineering. I'm a Product person at heart.
Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about User Experience, Design Systems or Product Management.

âš¡ Fun fact: The commit log for my profile repo is going to be me making a bunch of small tweaks because I just realized the web ui has a *Preview changes* tab. smh
