## WHAT WE ARE STRIKING FOR: 

üí∏ **Fair Pay:** 

Income inequality is a big issue in our union. Women earn 12% less on average than men. Black women and Hispanic or Latina women make 33% less than white men in the unit. Black workers earn 26% less than white workers.

üî® **Just Cause:** 

Just Cause is simply a standard process a company must follow to demonstrate a fair and just reason for firing an employee - but the company is insisting on including loopholes for that in the contract. Just Cause is often the core of, and a long running standard of, any union contract. Our amazing NYT News Guild colleagues, meanwhile, have had just cause enshrined in their contract for decades.


üè¢ **Return to Office (RTO) Protections:** 

the company wants to reserve the right to change the work arrangements of all its tech employees at any time - remote or hybrid - regardless of if they were hired fully remote (like me) and regardless of their contributions. Demanding that remote employees become in-person employees would upend lives for many of us in the union - many of whom are remote for financial, health, and/or personal reasons. The company says they probably would never do this - but they're unwilling to have it in writing.
